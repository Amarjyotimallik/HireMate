# HireMate Recruiter Guide
## Interpreting Behavioral Assessment Reports

---

## What HireMate Does (and Doesn't Do)

### ✅ What HireMate Provides
- **Behavioral observations** based on how candidates interact with assessment tasks
- **Pattern analysis** showing decision-making approaches
- **Relative comparisons** to population baselines
- **Confidence scores** indicating how reliable the analysis is

### ❌ What HireMate Does NOT Do
- Make hiring decisions for you
- Detect "cheating" with certainty
- Measure intelligence, personality, or character
- Replace human judgment

> **Key Principle:** HireMate provides behavioral observations to INFORM your decisions, not MAKE them.

## Understanding the Assessment Confidence Score

Every assessment includes a confidence score. **Always check this first.**

| Confidence Level | What It Means | What To Do |
|-----------------|---------------|------------|
| **High** (75%+) | Sufficient data, consistent patterns | Use results with confidence |
| **Moderate** (50-74%) | Some data limitations | Use as one input among many |
| **Low** (<50%) | Limited data or high variability | Request additional assessment or rely on interview |

### Factors That Affect Confidence
1. **Sample size** — More questions = higher confidence
2. **Data quality** — Complete event capture = higher confidence
3. **Pattern stability** — Consistent behavior = higher confidence
4. **Population context** — More comparison data = higher confidence

## Reading the Radar Chart (5 Dimensions)

Each axis shows an **observable behavioral pattern**, not a personality trait.

| Axis | What It Measures | What It Does NOT Measure |
|------|-----------------|------------------------|
| **Task Completion** | % of tasks completed + explanation detail | Intelligence or ability |
| **Selection Speed** | How quickly first choices were made | Confidence or competence |
| **Deliberation Pattern** | Time spent + explanation depth | Analytical ability |
| **Option Exploration** | How many options were considered | Creativity |
| **Risk Preference** | Timing patterns before choices | Risk tolerance |

### Drill-Down Evidence
Click any radar axis to see:
- The exact formula used to calculate the score
- Raw data points (times, counts, words)
- Contributing events from the assessment

**If a recruiter asks "Why did this spike here?" — you can answer with data.**

## Understanding Behavioral Consistency Analysis

This section identifies patterns that differ from typical independent problem-solving.

### Important: These Are Observations, Not Accusations

| What We Observe | Possible Innocent Explanations | When To Investigate |
|----------------|-------------------------------|-------------------|
| Rapid text entry | Pasting from personal notes | Combined with focus loss + generic content |
| Window navigation | Checking email, calendar | Extended absences + immediate answer changes |
| Content copying | Saving for personal records | Combined with paste events shortly after |
| Low timing variation | Consistent strategy | Combined with zero revisions + very fast times |
| Uniform explanations | Structured communication style | Combined with other anomalies |

### Red Flags vs. False Positives

**Likely Genuine Concern (Investigate):**
- Multiple paste events + immediate submission + no option exploration
- Copy events followed by paste events within seconds
- Very fast decisions + zero revisions + uniform timing + generic explanations

**Likely False Positive (Normal):**
- Fast decisions + detailed, specific explanations
- Zero revisions + high explanation quality
- Consistent timing + varied explanation content
- A few tab switches + no other anomalies

### Neurodiversity Considerations
Some candidates may show patterns that look "robotic" but are valid:
- **Consistent timing** — May indicate preference for routine/systematic approach
- **Zero revisions** — May indicate high confidence or decisive style
- **Extended deliberation** — May indicate thorough processing needs

**ACTION:** Look at explanation quality and logical structure, not just timing patterns.

## When to Override the System

You can always override HireMate's grade. Here's when you should:

### Override to UPGRADE
- Candidate's explanations show deep domain knowledge despite fast timing
- You have additional context (portfolio, references) that supports higher grade
- Assessment conditions were suboptimal (technical issues, interruptions)

### Override to DOWNGRADE
- Explanations are generic despite high behavioral scores
- You have concerns from other evaluation stages
- Role requires specific traits not captured by assessment

### Override to "Insufficient Data"
- Assessment was very short (< 3 questions completed)
- Technical issues affected the session
- Candidate reported problems during assessment

### Override Tracking
All overrides are logged with your reason. This helps us:
1. Improve the system over time
2. Identify patterns where the system under/over-estimates
3. Calibrate thresholds for your organization

## The Overall Fit Score

### Formula
```
FitScore = (Task × 0.30) + (Behavioral × 0.35) + (Skill × 0.25) + (Resume × 0.10) - ConsistencyAdjustment
```

### Grade Mapping
| Score | Grade | Label | Suggested Action |
|-------|-------|-------|-----------------|
| 90-100 | S | Exceptional Match | Fast-track to next stage |
| 80-89 | A | Strong Match | Proceed with confidence |
| 70-79 | B | Good Match | Proceed, note areas for discussion |
| 60-69 | C | Moderate Match | Additional evaluation recommended |
| 0-59 | D | Low Match | Consider alternative candidates |

### Important Disclaimers
- The grade is a **summary**, not a **verdict**
- Always review the breakdown to understand WHY a grade was assigned
- Consistency adjustments are capped at -10 points (reduced from -15)
- You can override any grade with a documented reason

## Privacy & Ethics

### What We Track
- ✓ Time between interactions
- ✓ Option selections and changes
- ✓ Text entry patterns (speed only, not content analysis)
- ✓ Focus changes (tab switches)

### What We DON'T Track
- ✗ Keystroke logging
- ✗ Screen recording
- ✗ Personal data inference
- ✗ Biometric data
- ✗ Content of reasoning (only length and structure)

### Key Principle
**Behavior ≠ Identity.** This assessment observes problem-solving patterns, not who the candidate is.

## Legal Compliance Checklist

Before sharing results with hiring managers:

- [ ] Confirm assessment confidence is "Moderate" or higher
- [ ] Review any behavioral consistency flags for context
- [ ] Check neurodiversity considerations
- [ ] Ensure grade reflects your professional judgment (override if needed)
- [ ] Include the standard disclaimer: "This assessment provides behavioral observations to supplement, not replace, human judgment in hiring decisions."

## FAQ

**Q: Can HireMate detect if someone used ChatGPT?**
A: No system can reliably detect AI usage directly. HireMate identifies behavioral patterns inconsistent with independent reasoning (e.g., rapid text entry, focus loss patterns). These patterns have multiple possible explanations.

**Q: What if a good candidate gets a low score?**
A: Check the confidence level first. If it's low, request additional assessment. If moderate/high, review the breakdown — the candidate may excel in areas not captured by this assessment. You can always override the grade.

**Q: Should I reject candidates with behavioral consistency flags?**
A: No. Flags are observations, not accusations. Review the "possible explanations" for each flag. Many flags have innocent explanations. Only investigate when multiple flags align.

**Q: How do I explain HireMate results to a candidate?**
A: Focus on behavioral observations: "We observed that you took a deliberative approach, spending more time on each question and providing detailed explanations." Avoid: "The AI says you're suspicious."
